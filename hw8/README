This assignment draws a rippling environment-mapped water surface with leaves blended
on top using a vertex shader and a fragment shader. Uses water and leaf textures
provided on course website. Additionally, the right mouse button toggles the
render mode for the normals, between per-vertex normal calculations (default)
and per-fragment normal calculations. The per-fragment calculations look smoother.

The program was tested in the computer lab, and can be compiled using `make`. It takes
the window size via commandline argument, so it can be envoked using:
`./glslRenderer <xRes> <yRes>`.

The code was tested and compared to the screenshot on the course website, and
all seems to work as desired.
