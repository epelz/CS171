This homework is very simple - it involves downloading sample code from Moodle
(`hw0.py`), and changing the color of the sphere from red to blue. This allowed
me to test that OpenGL and Python work in my environment.

To run this homework, simply type `python hw0.py`. This launches a Python app
with the blue sphere, which you can quit with the `q` key.
