Homework 4
CS 171, Fall 2013
Eric Pelz

This assignment contains a shaded renderer in OpenGL. It is a rewrite of the solution from
homework 3, but is also extended so that the user can examine (rotate, translate, and zoom) 
rendered object. The input format is OpenInventor, as in Homework 3. However, OpenGL
replaces the tedious work of rasterizing polygons and manually computing lighting functions.

The program can toggle among one of three shading modes with the press of a key:
  Wireframe (w), Flat (f), Gouraud (g)

The program can also rotate, translate, and zoom the object:
- Rotate by clicking and dragging using the left mouse button. This uses a simple approach
  by rotating the image by an amount proportional to the length of the mouse drag.
- Translate by clicking and dragging with the middle mouse button. The magnitude is proportional
  to the length of the mouse drag, and direction that of the mouse drag.
- Zoom by pressing shift and dragging with the middle mouse button. The magnitude is proportional
  to the vertical displacement of the mouse drag.

The program can be envoked using `python oglRenderer.py xRes yRes < iv-file`.

The code was testing using the test files on the course website, and all seems to work as desired.
